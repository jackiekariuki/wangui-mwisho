        <p>
          house of jackie began in an apartment in nyali, mombasa in March 2020 with 6 employees and a modem as a WI-FI hot-spot. The internet was too slow that it took 3 minutes to load a page. The first item sold by HOJ shortly after its launch in mid-March 2020 was a marron print shirt.
